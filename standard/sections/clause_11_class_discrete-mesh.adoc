[[class_discrete-mesh]]
== Class _discrete-mesh_

This class _discrete-mesh_ establishes those discrete coverages which have a non-zero topological dimension, thereby extending class _discrete-pointcloud_. As such, it defines coverages consisting of curve, surface, and solid bundles, resp.

| Requirement 28

| A coverage using the _discrete-mesh_ scheme *shall* implement class _discrete-pointcloud_.

|===
| Requirement 29

| A coverage using the _discrete-mesh_ scheme *shall* implement GMLCOV/CIS 1.0 coverage types CIS10::MultiCurveCoverage, CIS10::MultiSurfaceCoverage, and CIS10::MultiSolidCoverage.

|===

While this definition is based on the _conceptual_ model of GML it does not prescribe a GML _encoding_ (through class _gml-coverage_); the same structures may be represented in any other suitable format (using class _other-format-coverage_).
